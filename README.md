# Dotfiles
My personal environment

## Installation
If you want to install my `.dotfiles` follow the steps below.

#### Step 0
Clone the repo to the following directory: `/opt/dotfiles`

**Please note:** The setup script creates symbolic links, so you have to store the repo permanently.
For this reason we save the repo in `/opt` as mentioned above.

#### Step 1
Run the `install.sh` script to install all necessary components.

#### Step 2
Run the `setup.sh` script to apply the `.dotfiles`.
